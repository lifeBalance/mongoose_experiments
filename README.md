# mongoose_experiments
The **MongoDB Node.js driver** is the officially supported [Node.js][0] driver for MongoDB.  In 2012, [MongoDB][1] officially adopted the popular [Node MongoDB Native Project][2] and sponsored the project, maintained by [Christian Kvalheim here][3]. This driver is written in pure JavaScript and optimized for simplicity. It can be used on its own, but it also serves as the basis of several object mapping libraries, such as [Mongoose][4], the subject of our experiments :pill:

This repo is an [Express.js][5] project for experimenting with **Mongoose**, the most popular **ODM** (Object Document Mapper/Modeler) for modeling MongoDB databases in Node.js.
